# Empowering Vision: Smart Text Translation and Object Identification for the Visually Impaired
The assistive system would aid visually impaired individuals in detecting objects and reading text through computer vision, with audio feedback for the user.

## Hardware Used:
1. Raspberry Pi 4 Model Rev 1.2 (Minicomputer)
2. Pi Camera v2 (Image Acquisition)
3. HDMI Cables, Monitor, Power bank
4. MK240 Wireless Keyboard & Mouse
5. Smartphone (For Wireless Connection)
6. Headset

## Software Used:
1. Raspbian GNU/Linux 11 bullseye (OS of Raspberry Pi)
2. TensorFlow Lite (Lightweight ML Library)
3. OpenCV (Image Processing)
4. Pytesseract (Text Extraction using OCR)
5. Pygame (GUI Creation)
6. googletrans (Google Translate API)
7. gtts (Text-to-Speech)
8. Python
9. RealVNC (Remote Exist)

## Pros of the System
- Beginner-friendly setup (Inexpensive hardware, free software)
- Provides solid foundations for further refinement

## Cons of the System 
- Consistent text translation are only achieved with regular fonts and white & black colour
- Besides common objects (chair, bottle, fork, etc), object detection will not be successful
- Text-to-speeh are limited to five languages (English, German, French, Spanish, Italian)

## Proposed Improvement 
- Implementation of voice recognition for ease of use for the visually impaired
- Use other/custom dataset for wider range of object detection and text translation
- Use of more advanced and streamline hardware for better user expereince (Mic, compact headset, wireless earphone, etc)
